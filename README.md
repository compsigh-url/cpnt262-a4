# CPNT262-A4

## Description 

This app calculates a price of a pizza based on topping you select.

Example Commands :
- node app.js --t1 Cheese --t2 Pepperoni
- node app.js --t1 adsffdhis --t2 fdijsafhd
- node app.js

I used yargs to get input from the command line. On line 11 I use 'toppings.t1.toString().toUpperCase()' to get the value of 't1' from the toppings variable.
